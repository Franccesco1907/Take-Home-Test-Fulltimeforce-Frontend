# Github History Commits - Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project allow see Github History Commits of [Take-Home-Test-Fulltimeforce-Backend](https://github.com/Franccesco1907/Take-Home-Test-Fulltimeforce-Backend).

Note: I used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for component styles.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies needed to run the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.	

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
